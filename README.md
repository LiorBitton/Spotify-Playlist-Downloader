# Spotify Playlist Downloader

This code allows downloading a spotify playlist to local media files.

## How to Use

Run "download spotify playlist .py", from there the prompts are pretty much straight forward, if you want to convert the songs to
mp3 instead of webm you need to [install ffmpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).

### note

This code does not correspond to the terms of service of Youtube and Spotify and so it should not be used commercially and for personal purposes. This project serves a way to learn about web scraping in python.
