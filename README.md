# Spotify Playlist Downloader

This code allows downloading a spotify playlist to local media files.

### note

This code does not correspond to the terms of Youtube and Spotify and so it should not be used commercially and for personal purposes. This project serves a way to learn about web scraping in python.

## Improvements

-   [x] Allow download path selection
-   [ ] Scrape more information about the playlist
-   [ ] Convert the final files to mp3 instead of .webm
-   [ ] Check if the youtube video contains the requested song
