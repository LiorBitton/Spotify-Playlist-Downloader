# Spotify Playlist Downloader

This code allows downloading a spotify playlist to local media files.

### note

This code does not correspond to the terms of service of Youtube and Spotify and so it should not be used commercially and for personal purposes. This project serves a way to learn about web scraping in python.

## How to Use

Run "download spotify playlist .py", from there the prompts are pretty much straight forward, if you want to convert the songs to
mp3 instead of webm you need to [install ffmpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).

## Improvements

-   [x] Allow download path selection
-   [x] Scrape more information about the playlist
-   [x] Convert the final files to mp3 instead of .webm
-   [ ] Check if the youtube video contains the requested song
